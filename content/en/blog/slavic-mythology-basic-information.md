### What is Slavic mythology?

Slavic mythology is a collection of beliefs and myths of the Slavic peoples who inhabited the areas of Eastern, Central and Southern Europe. Like other mythologies, it tells the story of gods, spirits and heroes who play key roles in the natural order of the world and human life.

### Unique features of Slavic mythology

Slavic mythology is distinguished by its strong connection with nature. The gods and spirits that appear in it are closely related to forests, rivers, mountains and other elements of the natural environment. Deities such as Perun, the god of storm and war, or Mokosz, the goddess of the earth and fertility, reflect the deep connection of the Slavs with nature.

Also, the Slavic belief system is based on the idea of dualism and balance between good and evil, which can be seen in figures such as white and black deities that symbolize the positive and negative aspects of life. This harmony between opposites is crucial to understanding the Slavic perspective of the world.

### Why is so little known about Slavic mythology?

One of the main reasons why Slavic mythology is less known than other mythologies is the lack of written sources. Many of these myths were passed down orally for centuries and only later began to be written down. Additionally, the expansion of Christianity into Slavic areas resulted in many of these beliefs being replaced or assimilated by the new religion, making it even more difficult to preserve the original myths.

### What distinguishes Slavic mythology from others?

One of the most characteristic features of Slavic mythology is its richness and diversity of local variants of myths and beliefs. Due to the wide geographic spread of the Slavic peoples, different regions developed their own unique histories and deities, which often had their own local names and attributes. This regional diversity accounts for the richness and complexity of the Slavic cultural heritage.

### Basic deities and myths

Among the pantheon of Slavic gods we find characters such as:
- **Perun**: supreme god, ruler of storm, lightning and war.
- **Mokosz**: goddess of the earth, fertility and the protective power of women.
- **Swaróg**: god of sky, fire and blacksmithing, creator of the universe.
- **Swarożyc**: son of Swarog, god of fire and sun.
- **Świętowit**: god of war, fertility and abundance, often depicted with four faces looking in the four directions of the world.
- **Jaryło**: god of spring, vegetation, fertility and growth.
- **Rod**: considered the creator of the human race, the highest lineage deity.
- **Weles**: god of the underworld, magic, trade and cattle.
- **Dazbóg**: god of the sun and fire, giving life and warmth.


In Slavic mythology, there are several versions of the myth about the creation of the world, including one about creation by diving. Sounds interesting and unique? In this version, in the beginning there were only the sky and the sea. God, riding in a boat, and the devil, emerging from the sea foam, decided to create the earth. The devil dived in, pulling out a handful of sand from the bottom, which, after being thrown into the water by God, became the beginning of the earth. Other versions of the myth also tell of cooperation and conflict between divine and devilish figures, emphasizing the dualistic nature of the Slavic cosmogony​

In future articles we intend to take a closer look at individual gods, myths and legends to better understand their meaning and influence on Slavic culture.

### Summary
Slavic mythology is a treasure trove of stories that reflect the beliefs and values of the Slavic peoples. With its rich pantheon and deep connection with nature, it is a fascinating cultural heritage. Although often overlooked in comparison to other mythological traditions, it offers a unique insight into the beliefs and values of the peoples who shaped the history and culture of Eastern, Central and Southern Europe.
