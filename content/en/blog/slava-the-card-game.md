<!--more-->
# Welcome to our blog!

Hello to all card game lovers and fans of Slavic mythology! Today we have amazing news for you that will probably warm your hearts and expand the horizons of your board game.

Soon we will set off on a journey through fairy-tale lands and immerse ourselves in the richness of Slavic mythology using a new card game - **Slava! The Card Game**.

## Mythology of the Slavs

Slavic mythology is a rich source of legends, myths and stories that reflect the beliefs and traditions of the ancient Slavs. In this fascinating cosmos, we meet gods, heroes, demons and other fantastic beings who have aroused the imagination and inspired creators for centuries.

## Demons and Gods

In Slavic mythology, we meet both benevolent deities and dark demonic beings. Gods such as Perun - the god of thunder and war, Veles - the god of cattle, trade and the underworld, and Svarog - the god of fire and crafts, are central figures in Slavic mythology. However, there are also sinister demons, such as Zmey Gorynych - a multi-headed dragon, Lubyan - a forest spirit, or Baba Yaga - an evil witch living in her hut on a chickens foot.

## Slava! The Card Game

In **Slava!** players will have the opportunity to explore this rich world by collecting cards depicting various characters, creatures, spells and artifacts from Slavic mythology. Each card will not only reflect the image of a given character or item, but also bring unique skills and strategies to the game, making the game full of surprises and emotions.

So look forward to the premiere of **Slava! The Card Game** and get ready for a fascinating journey through the mysterious world of Slavic mythology!
