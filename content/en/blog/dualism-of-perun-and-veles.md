In Slavic mythology, one of the most fascinating aspects is the dualism between Perun and Veles. These two gods represent opposing forces and values, which, however, coexist harmoniously in the richness of the Slavic faith.

## Perun - God of Heaven and Thunder

Perun, also known as the "Lord of Thunder", is one of the most important gods in Slavic mythology. It is a symbol of strength, bravery and justice. His attributes are lightning, an ax and a shield. Perun was worshiped as the god of heaven who ruled the world from Mount Światowida, which was the central place of worship.

Perun is a warrior figure, often shown fighting evil and demons that threaten the cosmic order. His actions symbolize the protection of people from the dangers of nature and the enemies of the community.

## Weles - God of the Underground World and Animals

Veles, unlike Perun, is a god associated with the underworld, death and animals. His figure is often identified with the figure of a snake or a wolf. Weles is the protector of animals, shepherds and natural resources such as grain and cattle.

As the god of the underworld, Weles plays the role of a guide of the souls of the dead and a guardian of goods hidden underground. He is also the patron saint of craftsmen and merchants, as he is credited with knowledge of secret treasures hidden in the earth.

## Harmony of Opposites

The dualism of Perun and Veles symbolizes the fundamental oppositions present in the cosmic order of Slavic mythology. Perun represents strength, light and heaven, while Veles is associated with darkness, earth and the underworld. However, despite these opposites, both gods are extremely important to maintaining balance in the world.

The harmony of opposites between Perun and Veles shows that neither of them can exist without the other. Perun needs Weles to maintain the balance between heaven and earth, light and darkness. Likewise, Weles needs Perun to ensure protection and order among the people.

## Conclusions

The dualism of Perun and Veles is a key element of Slavic mythology, which illustrates the deep complexity and harmony of opposites in the Slavic religious system. Their stories and symbols continue to inspire and fascinate researchers and mythology lovers, emphasizing the cultural richness and spiritual heritage of the Slavs.
